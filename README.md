## Cross Product: 
- def: A vector made up of the product of the magnitudes of two vectors and the sine of the angle between them.
  The cross product of vector **A** and **B** in three-dimensional space is defined as:

\[
\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
A_x & A_y & A_z \\
B_x & B_y & B_z
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Where:
- \(\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k}\) are the unit vectors in the **x**, **y**, and **z** directions respectively.
- \(A_x, A_y, A_z\) are the components of vector **A**.
- \(B_x, B_y, B_z\) are the components of vector **B**.

The result of the cross product is a vector that is perpendicular to both **A** and **B**.
